		<p1> <b> Hello World <br /></b></p1>
		<p2> There wasn't really anything I wanted to do with this, I just saw it was an option and wanted to see if I could get it to work</p2>
		<p3> <br /> Hey. This should work too, so check this sometimes. Everyone should be able to edit this, and I'll see if I can get it so you can submit input </p3>
		<p4> <br /> happy birthdayish. i don't know when this'll get to you, but hopefully around then. as you seem to have figured out, i decided to do something in the spirit of our usual birthday celebrations. how hard was the keyed rot cypher? if you can write me back, please do, and let me know how it's going. nothing too exciting is happening here really, midterms got cancelled a while back, and that was probably the most exciting thing to happen recently. although i did do a fun coding thing a few days ago, it had to do with creating a solution for the 'chinese remainder theorem' in code. that's essentially saying the if there is some number that mod 3 is 2, mod 5 is 3, and mod 7 is 2, what is that number. it was a good time. anyways, happy birthday, i'm sad we're missing it. </p4>
