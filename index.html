		<h2> Updates </h2>
		<p1> Hey, I got your messages. Now that I know that this works, I'll open it up to other people so they can contact you through it. As for a p2p chat sort of thing, Github only lets me host a static webpage, so I can't do any fun stuff with the backend, like update message requests. I do have plans though, I might be able to make a discord server that would let people send messages in a channel that would get added to this page in the format shown below, and that would display anything you sent through that text box on the server. I'll work on that and try to get it up. Also, I think I'll make a bot that takes the top reddit posts of the day and adds them to this webpage, so you have some access point to the world, so send a list of what subreddits you want me to add to that. The email thing works with whatever you put in the reply box. Let me know if you have any good ideas for functionality or anything else you want me to add to this site -Jackson </p1>
