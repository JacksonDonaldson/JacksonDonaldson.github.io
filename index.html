		<p1> Luis made a better website, if it isn't blocked. Check borth.xyz, it has actual styling and everything.<br> Hey Noah. My computer shut down at some point before you started sending messages, so they only got through once I got home and turned the computer on. The scripts work though. I'm going to double check and make sure none of the auto shut down settings are on, I though I turned those off. Can you access borth.xyz? I might end up actually making a webserver and hosting it on that, or Luis might have something.</p1>

Let me explain.So I fully understand why these jobs are bullshit, demoralizing etc. and also why they are created. For instance flunkies for prestige and managers being lazy or duct-tapers cause the people doing the work were too lazy to check if it works well or it still needs tweaks. What I don't get is so many workers get fired for the slighest of mistakes and also (according to neoclassical theory) wouldn't market competition drive bosses and managers to eliminate all possible roles that are pointless/bullshit? So why are there so many? How do lazy managers get away with hiring a flunky just to pick the phone up/for prestige, why does someone in a museum get hired just to suprevise an empty room, why do all the other examples mentioned in the book exist?I guess what I don't get is that capitalism is supposed to be this ultra-efficient highly competetive system, which should not let these types of jobs exist. Also why did he claim that burocratic/administrative work increases with privatization and the expansion of the private sector,as well as that only 46% of your shift is actually spent working and the other is just administrative/BS meetings etc. and that this just seems decrease overtime. (I don't get these either due to the aforementioned reasons.)If the answers to my questions are addressed later in the book just tell me to read the fucking book and stop whining about it online. If not and you guys know any other sources on this I'd grealy appreciate you guys linking me there.

Since the GME stock market stuff is so hot right now, I figured itd be a good time to post this here right now.The stock market is clearly a typical capitalist invention. It is intertwined with it and it is a way of making money with money (capital accumulation) without creating any actual value, which is the very basis of capitalism. Besides this, it opens the possibility of influencing the actual real world with all kinds of capitalist investment hocus pocus, such as artificially jacking up prices or selling people bonds with corrupt credit ratings. So, it is capitalist and makes it possible for rich people to do real harm. Now, this is all very heavy anti-stockmarket stuff, I agree with all of it and I think many anarchists would agree with the abolishment of the stock in an anarchist society. However, sometimes I see critique I dont seem to agree with and Id like to briefly state why.Theres multiple ways of investing on the stock market and a lot of different things going on. Lets look at some different stock market entities, starting with the worst one:-**Dividend:** This one is a direct re-distribution of the profit that a company makes to its shareholders. Therefore, I agree dividends are a way of directly stealing from the labourers, since the company makes profit merely by claiming the surplus-value of its labourers and then pays part of that to its shareholders, who have no hand in creating any of the value.-**Stocks:** Regular stocks are different however. I often see people claiming that this is directly stealing from the workers as well, but I think I disagree. Stocks are basically gambling and they are decoupled from reality. Sure, in a broad way, the better work the employees perform, the better the quality of the commodities will be and this will most likely make the stock more interesting, but thats by far not what happens on the actual stock market at all times. Stocks dont become more valuable because the workers create more surplus-value and those two variables dont seem properly related to each other. For example, I could have made a 200% profit on GME stocks because value soared for a few minutes. This profit would in no way be stolen from the actual workers, since they did not actually create that value. So I dont think stocks steal from workers as dividends do, for example. It feels as merely gambling on socio-economic tendencies. What is the general anarchist view on gambling, anyway? Does that mean it could be anarchist praxis to invest in stocks? For example, I dont have the budget to influence markets as big investment companies do, but I could have the budget to make sure Im able to stop living from paycheck to paycheck. Or I could spend the money I made through stocks on other anarchist praxis. Or, as is shown in recent days, I could use my money in order to point out all ridiculous mechanisms of the stock market and radicalize people to hold anti-capitalist ideas while doing so, as WSB is doing rn. -**Bonds:** Bonds are basically loans in which you get to be the loan shark, being, you give a company money and they pay you back with interest. This, again, is a way of making money with money, which I dont agree with, but in this case, you actually steal from the company, rather than directly from its workers. Since pooping on company time is often cited as a comical way of anarchist praxis because youre stealing value from your company, could investing in bonds be seen as a similar way of praxis? Sure, a counter-argument could be that at the same time you are probably helping a company out by supplying them with money. In that sense, how are bonds different from crowdfunding (which seems to be a way of financing stuff that anarchists seem to agree with)?  Thinking about this stuff, I was often wondering whether, within the system we are forced to live in now, investing on the stock market could actually be anarchist praxis, or whether doing so would ultimately and only be collaborating with the enemy, the capitalist class. So, people, Im not arguing that the stock market is morally defensible as a concept, but merely whether partaking in it is always morally wrong or not. This is just what I have been thinking about recently. I would absolutely love it if people that know more about anarchism, the stock market, or both, could point out where Im wrong, or where you disagree. Furthermore, I would really appreciate any recommendation of anarchist critiques of the stock market, if such texts exist.Edit: I'm very glad to see many people stepping up with great comments and recommendations, thank you!
