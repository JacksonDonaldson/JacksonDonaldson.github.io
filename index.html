		<h2> Updates </h2>
		<p1> Hey, I got your messages. Now that I know that this works, I'll open it up to other people so they can contact you through it. As for a p2p chat sort of thing, Github only lets me host a static webpage, so I can't do any fun stuff with the backend, like update message requests. I do have plans though, I might be able to make a discord server that would let people send messages in a channel that would get added to this page in the format shown below, and that would display anything you sent through that text box on the server. I'll work on that and try to get it up. Also, I think I'll make a bot that takes the top reddit posts of the day and adds them to this webpage, so you have some access point to the world, so send a list of what subreddits you want me to add to that. The email thing works with whatever you put in the reply box. Let me know if you have any good ideas for functionality or anything else you want me to add to this site -Jackson  <br> I got the first half of the script working, it now checks every 10 minutes while my computer is on for a new email from you, then takes the info from that and posts it to a discord server. I'll work on the half that auto-updates this html file tomorrow, as it's like 10 and unlike some people, I have a decent sleep schedule. Is that enforced there, by the way? - Also Jackson</p1>

It's buggy, but check jacksondonaldson.github.io to see if your message gets sent, it there are issues, that's where Noah accesses all these messages. If you send any messages after I go to bed and turn off my computer, they won't get sent, I'll work on it.<br>MetricBead: Alright, it mostly works now. This script is full of places for potential failures, and it only works while my pc is running- Any messages sent while it's off will not get noticed. I'll try when I have extra time to make it send off everything that happens when my pc is off, but this works for now.<br>NoahBot: checking again, because listener wasn't listening<br>MetricBead: I'm typing this on the discord server right now. It's pretty slow to actually update the website, because I'm using github and that doesn't update it super often. But it sends the messages you send to this channel and duplicates this channel on the website. You'll have to reload to check for new messages, because it's actually changing the contents of the page, and won't update you of it<br>MetricBead: test too many<br>NoahBot: test 2<br>NoahBot: test message from Jackson<br>MetricBead: Let's go!<br>MetricBead: It worksish?<br>MetricBead: aasdf<br>MetricBead: asdjlkf<br>MetricBead: adslk;jf<br>MetricBead: test 8<br>MetricBead: test 7<br>MetricBead: test 6<br>(Script to be implemented) <br> Jackson: Some message <br> Isa: Some message <br> Jesse: Some message </p2>
