		<p1> Hey Noah. My computer shut down at some point before you started sending messages, so they only got through once I got home and turned the computer on. The scripts work though. I'm going to double check and make sure none of the auto shut down settings are on, I though I turned those off. Can you access borth.xyz? I might end up actually making a webserver and hosting it on that, or Louis might have something.</p1>

They're sending to my email, but the script is down for some reason, so I'm just relaying them manually. I just realized I can edit this HTML file from my phone, because it's on GitHub. I think what happened was the script died after my computer went to idle. I get home at like 1:30, so I'll check everything then, and update you again by 2, hopefully <br> MetricBead: Great, I think it worke, so you should be able to send and recieve messages today<br>NoahBot: test to make sure things worked before I leave for school.

It's buggy, but check jacksondonaldson.github.io to see if your message gets sent, it there are issues, that's where Noah accesses all these messages. If you send any messages after I go to bed and turn off my computer, they won't get sent, I'll work on it.<br>MetricBead: Alright, it mostly works now. This script is full of places for potential failures, and it only works while my pc is running- Any messages sent while it's off will not get noticed. I'll try when I have extra time to make it send off everything that happens when my pc is off, but this works for now.<br>NoahBot: checking again, because listener wasn't listening<br>MetricBead: I'm typing this on the discord server right now. It's pretty slow to actually update the website, because I'm using github and that doesn't update it super often. But it sends the messages you send to this channel and duplicates this channel on the website. You'll have to reload to check for new messages, because it's actually changing the contents of the page, and won't update you of it<br>MetricBead: test too many<br>NoahBot: test 2<br>NoahBot: test message from Jackson<br>MetricBead: Let's go!<br>MetricBead: It worksish?<br>MetricBead: aasdf<br>MetricBead: asdjlkf<br>MetricBead: adslk;jf<br>MetricBead: test 8<br>MetricBead: test 7<br>MetricBead: test 6<br>(Script to be implemented) <br> Jackson: Some message <br> Isa: Some message <br> Jesse: Some message </p2>
