				<h1> A Portable Desktop Computer</h1>
				<p> I don't like laptops. They're slow and hard to repair, and having two devices to sync files and environments between is annoying. Inspired by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/phwyie/my_new_micro_build/">Microwave PC</a> I helped a friend build, I figured I would build a computer in a briefcase to fix all those problems. </p>
				
				<p> My first attempt below accomplished a lot of what I wanted, with enough room left over to carry a full size mechanical keyboard. </p>

				<p> It was also quite bulky though, and a pain to carry around, so after a year or so I started looking for an upgrade path. I looked for a while for a case I could buy that was only just large enough to fit all the components but couldn't find anything, so I had to make it myself.</p>
				<p> After a lot of modeling in SolidWorks, I had a good idea of how I wanted to arrange everything. I ordered some specialty small form-factor parts, and started 3D printing </p>

				<p> A lot of these parts I ended up printing in ABS on my Ender 3 without an enclosure. (Don't do that. It took like 5 tries for every part.) I printed the remainder where heat resistance was less important in PLA with the help of the University Of Michigan Design lab. </p>
				<p> After several hundred hours of print time and iteration, here's my final result </p>

				<h3> Parts List </h3>
				<p> PSU: TF550 Flex ITX form factor (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Supply-Modular-90-264V-Desktop-Computer/dp/B0BVVF656F">link</a>). Off brand but quite reliable so far, except for that one time I forgot to cut a hole for air intake and then tried to play Baldur's Gate 3. Can't blame it for that though.</p>
				<p> GPU: 3060, Phoenix V2 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-DisplayPort-Axial-tech-Protective-Auto-Extreme/dp/B09CBS8ZF3">link</a>). The smallest 3060 I could find. You'll also need a PCIE riser cable.</p>
				<p> Motherboard: Gigabyte B550I (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089FWWN62">link</a>)</p>
				<p> Fan: Noctua NH-L9a-AM4 chromax.Black (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NH-L9a-AM4-chromax-Black-Low-Profile-Cooler/dp/B083LQVX5W/">link</a>)</p>
				<p> For everything else you can probably use whatever's handy, although a M.2 SSD is a must. As for the monitor, I just bought a panel with a controller off AliExpress and velcro'd it to the top half. </p>
